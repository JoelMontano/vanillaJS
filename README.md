random JS projects to practice

Calculator:
12/20/20 - Made to practice functions, eventlistners, and modifying html with JS. it's ugly but works, might circle back to it later if I feel like dealing with the CSS

NYT API:
12/20/20 - Got to mess around with NYT top stories API. Practiced Fetch API, creating/editing HTML elements, fetching/displaying API data, appendChild. Whoever created this syntax sucks
